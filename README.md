**Color**  

Color in material design is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights.

**The color palette**  

This color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The color palette starts with primary colors and fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable palette for Android, Web, and iOS. Google suggests using the 500 colors as the primary colors in your app and the other colors as accents colors.
